## An Analysis of Calgary Satisfaction Data and Safety


Calgary is experiencing a record surge in population growth, making safety and satisfaction key considerations for newcomers. This project analyzes 2022 resident satisfaction data to identify factors influencing satisfaction and safety across different areas. Targeted at newcomers, the study aims to answer four main questions:

Which area(s) in Calgary has the highest satisfaction level?
How does satisfaction vary among different demographic groups (e.g., age, gender, income, education) in different areas of Calgary?
How safe do Calgarians feel, and what areas report higher safety levels? Does safety correlate with satisfaction levels?
Can we find relationships between community crime statistics and reported levels of satisfaction on safety?
The findings aim to guide newcomers in choosing areas that best meet their needs for a safe and fulfilling lifestyle in Calgary. This project was completed in collaboration with colleagues.
